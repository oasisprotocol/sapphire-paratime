</p>

In this tutorial, you will build and deploy a unique dApp that requires
confidentiality to work. By the end of the tutorial, you should feel
comfortable setting up your EVM development environment to target Sapphire,
and know how and when to use confidentiality.

The expected completion time of this tutorial is 15 minutes.

## Create a Sapphire-Native dApp

Porting an existing EVM app is cool, and will provide benefits such as
protection against MEV.
However, starting from scratch with confidentiality in mind can unlock some
really novel dApps and provide a [higher level of security].

One simple-but-useful dApp that takes advantage of confidentiality is a
[dead person's switch] that reveals a secret (let's say the encryption key to a
data trove) if the operator fails to re-up before too long.
Let's make it happen!

### Init a new Hardhat project

We're going to use Hardhat with TypeScript which relies on NodeJS, but Sapphire
should be compatible with your dev environment of choice. See examples in
[Go][Oasis starter project for Go] and
[Python][Oasis starter project for Python] at the end of this chapter. Let us
know if things are not as expected!

[Oasis starter project for Go]: https://github.com/oasisprotocol/demo-starter-go
[Oasis starter project for Python]: https://github.com/oasisprotocol/demo-starter-py

1. Make & enter a new directory:

   ```sh
   mkdir quickstart && cd quickstart
   ```

2. Create a TypeScript project and install the project dependencies:

   ```sh
   npx hardhat init
   ```

3. Add [`@oasisprotocol/sapphire-hardhat`] as dependency:

   ```shell npm2yarn
   npm install -D @oasisprotocol/sapphire-hardhat
   ```

### Add the Sapphire Testnet to Hardhat

Open up your `hardhat.config.ts` and import `sapphire-hardhat`.

![code typescript {2}](../examples/hardhat/hardhat.config.ts#config-preamble)

By importing `@oasisprotocol/sapphire-hardhat`, **any network config entry
corresponding to the Sapphire's chain ID will automatically be wrapped with
Sapphire specifics for encrypting and signing the transactions**.

Next, let's add an account with a private key from an environment variable:

![code typescript {6-12}](../examples/hardhat/hardhat.config.ts#config-preamble)

Finally, let's add the [Sapphire Testnet] network to the network property of
`HardhatUserConfig`:

![code typescript {4-19}](../examples/hardhat/hardhat.config.ts#config-networks)

### Get some Sapphire Testnet tokens

Now for the fun part. As you have configured the Sapphire Test network, get
some native TEST tokens. Hit up the one and only [Oasis Testnet faucet], select
"Sapphire" and enter your wallet address. Submit the form and TEST be on your
way.

[Oasis Testnet faucet]: https://faucet.testnet.oasis.io
[Sapphire Testnet]: ./network.mdx

### Get the Contract

This is a Sapphire tutorial and you're already a Solidity expert, so let's not
bore you with explaining the gritty details of the contract.
Start by pasting `Vigil.sol` into `contracts/Vigil.sol`.

1. Create a new file called `Vigil.sol` under `contracts/`:
2. Paste the following contract into it:

<details>
  <summary> Vigil.sol contract </summary>

  ![code solidity](../examples/hardhat/contracts/Vigil.sol)
</details>


#### Vigil.sol, the interesting parts

The key state variables are:

```solidity
    SecretMetadata[] public _metas;
    bytes[] private _secrets;
```

* `_metas` is marked with `public` visibility, so despite the state itself being
  encrypted and not readable directly, Solidity will generate a getter that will
  do the decryption for you.
* `_secrets` is `private` and therefore truly secret; only the contract can
  access the data contained in this mapping.

And the methods we'll care most about are

* `createSecret`, which adds an entry to both `_metas` and `_secrets`.
* `revealSecret`, which acts as an access-controlled getter for the data
  contained with `_secrets`. Due to trusted execution and confidentiality, the
  only way that the secret will get revealed is if execution proceeds all the
  way to the end of the function and does not revert.

The rest of the methods are useful if you actually intended to use the contract,
but they demonstrate that developing for Sapphire is essentially the same as for
Ethereum. You can even write tests against the Hardhat network and use Hardhat
plugins.

### Add the Tasks

We will use [Hardhat tasks] to automate the deployment and testing of the
Vigil contract.

1. Create a new file called `index.ts` under `tasks/`:
2. Paste the following tasks to the `tasks/index.ts`:

<details>
  <summary> tasks/index.ts </summary>

  ![code typescript](../examples/hardhat/tasks/index.ts)
</details>

3. Import the tasks inside `hardhat.config.ts`:

![code typescript {4}](../examples/hardhat/hardhat.config.ts#config-preamble)

[Hardhat tasks]: https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/guides/tasks

### Run the Contract

And to wrap things up, we'll put `Vigil` through its paces.
First, let's see what's actually going on.

After deploying the contract, we can create a secret, check that it's not
readable, wait a bit, and then check that it has become readable.
Pretty cool if you ask me!

Anyway, make it happen by running

```shell
PRIVATE_KEY="0x..." npx hardhat full-vigil --network sapphire-testnet
```

And if you see something like the following, you'll know you're well on the road
to deploying confidential dApps on Sapphire.

```
Vigil deployed to: 0x74dC4879B152FDD1DDe834E9ba187b3e14f462f1
Storing a secret in 0x13125d868f5fb3cbc501466df26055ea063a90014b5ccc8dfd5164dc1dd67543
Checking the secret
failed to fetch secret: reverted: not expired
Waiting...
Checking the secret again
The secret ingredient is brussel sprouts
```
