# Develop on Sapphire

As Sapphire is EVM-compatible, you can use the same dev tooling as you would
when building on Ethereum. Additionally, we build tools to support you in
creating secure and confidential dApps.

Feel free to check out the [Concepts] page to get a better understanding of the
transaction flow and the contract state.

[Concepts]: ./concept.mdx

## Contract Development

Sapphire is programmable using any language that targets the EVM, such as Solidity,
Fe or Vyper. If you prefer to use an Ethereum framework like Hardhat or Foundry,
you can also use those with Sapphire; all you need to do is set your Web3 gateway URL.
You can find the details of the Oasis Sapphire Web3 endpoints
on the [Network information] page.

[Network information]: ../network.mdx#rpc-endpoints

## Backend Development

If you want to connect and execute transactions from your backend.
Sapphire has three clients in different programming languages:
